# Configuring Error Classifications
#
# Each of the standard errors detected by BurnInTest can configured 
# to include a customer specific string and error classification. 
# The file BITErrorClassification.txt (this file that stored in the 
# software directory) contains the error text and classification used 
# by BurnInTest. 
#
# The file is formatted as a Comma Separated File with four fields:
#
# 1. Error number – this must not be changed by the customer; 
# 2. Error description text – this may be changed. This must be a 
#    sting enclosed by quotes; 
# 3. Error classification – this may be changed. This must be one 
#    of the following text values (not in quotes):  
#      CRITICAL, SERIOUS, WARNING, or INFORMATION 
#
# 4. Customer comment – this is optional and may be changed – it is 
#    ignored by BurnInTest. 
#
#
# Notes:
#   (i) BurnInTest must be restarted after making changes to this file.
#  (ii) You need to run BurnInTest with sufficient privileges to save 
#       this file in the BurnInTest directory.
# (iii) A comment is indicated by a "#" at the start of the line.
#  (iv) This file may be deleted on uninstalling BurnInTest or installing
#       a new version of BurnInTest. It is recommended that you keep a 
#       separate copy of this file.
